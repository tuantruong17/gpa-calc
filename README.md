# GPA Calculator for Augustana Students

Currently hosted by GitHub Pages at: https://augustanacomputerscienceprojects.github.io/gpa-calc/

This GPA calculator is designed for the grading system at Augustana College in Rock Island, IL.  

This calculator can help students predict what your semester and cumulative GPA will be (after the current semester is over), based on estimated final grades in each current course.

Originally development by Tuan Truong (class of '22), with a few enhancements by Dr. Forrest Stonedahl (independent study supervisor).  
If new features or modifications are required in the future, it may be maintained by other Augustana computer science students.

## Development Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `npm run deploy`

Uses **gh-pages** to push the static build to the gh-pages branch on GitHub, which is then automatically served on GitHub pages.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
